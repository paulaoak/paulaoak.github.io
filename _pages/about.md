Hello ! I am a second-year PhD candidate in Statistics and Machine Learning at Imperial College London and the University of Oxford, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Andrew Duncan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3ZzC72cAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Deniz Akyildiz](https://akyildiz.me/). 

Before starting my PhD, I completed a double BSc. degree in [Mathematics and Physics at Universidad Complutense de Madrid](https://www.elespanol.com/reportajes/20210605/fisica-matematicas-doble-empresas-rifaran-ismael-paula/586442818_0.html). I then pursued an MSc. in Machine Learning at Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid and an MSc. in  [Statistics at Imperial College London](https://youtu.be/55vNkwPdUs8).

**Research interests**. 
My research focuses on problems at the intersection of generative modelling, optimal transport, sampling, diffusion processes, stochastic differential equations (SDEs), probability theory and machine learning theory. I am particularly interested in establishing theoretical guarantees for machine learning algorithms and developing principled methodologies informed by these insights. Always happy to discuss these topics!
