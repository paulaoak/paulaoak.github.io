I have been invited to give a talk at the 2nd RSS Workshop on Gradient Flows for Sampling, Inference, and Learning at the Alan Turing Institute in London, UK. I will talk about my latest work, [Non-asymptotic Analysis of Diffusion Annealed Langevin Monte Carlo for Generative Modelling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09306). Looking forward to discussing with everyone there! 

**Update:** You can watch a recording of the talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrPy49eAe9o).
